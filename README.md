### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**PrinceShah05/PrinceShah05** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

My name is Mohammed Shahrukh and I am a second-year Master of Interational Affairs student. I am concentrating in Human Rights and Humanitarian Policy and specializing in International Conflict Resolution. I am excited to be in this class and am currently working on the rights of minorities especially in the anthropocene and the era of social media propaganda. I have conducted primary source analyses of political magazines and social media pages before, but am looking forward to doing that usng Python now.
